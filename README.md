## music tomb

A quiet place for the songs that shaped me. Each page is a memory, a feeling, a note to myself or to someone I once loved. You can listen, read, wander, and maybe leave with something soft.

There’s no guide. Just click around. Every song has its own space. art, lyrics, a personal message hidden behind a gentle wall. Some things are meant to be discovered slowly.

This isn’t for everyone. It’s just a little archive for when I want to remember, and for anyone who wants to see what music meant to me.
