    lyrics: `Baby please, it's the way you speak
Forming words so easily
And I think of the way you think
It keeps me from falling asleep
In that grave I call a bed
Until you called me up and said:

"I haven't stopped crying
My father's been drinking
I need a place to stay
I don't want to be here
He's saying the words that
He promised he would never say
That liquid he consumes
Makes him speak the truth"

And I said, "No, It's not that at all
It's that bottle of lies for a troubled heart
It's standing on the edge of a mountain top
Screaming anything he wants like
"Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Because I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist"

I remember the way you shook
It's a shame that we're not soul mates
Because if I didn't know better
I'd say this feels pretty good
And how could I be scared
When I stretch and feel you're there
So shut your mouth
Because these words will speak themselves
I can feel them in these blankets
And they're surrounding your figure
Embraced in the quilts
And I can't help but think
You're my missing puzzle piece

I wake up in the hallway, I'm looking for sunlight
With the rays that will cure me of the pain that keeps my lungs tight
Ignoring the voices and feelings that tell me
To get out of this house
I can't make them stop
I'm just like my mom

And you said, "No, these demons will fall
You're so precious to us all"
And I said, "I, I can't do this alone
I still need you to hold
So don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Because I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid"`,
    note: `I’m gonna change. Okay? I can do it. I can change. I will be who I want to be. People grow and change. Some day, I won’t hate myself and the people I surround myself with. I’ll be okay. We can do this.`

    note: `maybe you could hurt me

Hurt me just a little

To help me ease the pain

Or maybe you could kill me

One to the back of the head

Just leave me in the rain

Or what if we decided

Instead we’d hold each other

For a little while

But maybe forever

And maybe we’d be the fifty percent

That didn’t quite make it

Or maybe we could have it all

Twenty kids and a picket

And maybe..

We could live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.

Maybe it’s a little

Silly fantasy of mine

But we could build our home

In the thickets and vines

No one around to bother us

No one to bring us harm

Just me and our beach home

And you to keep me warm..

oh..

We could live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.

Is it

So

Much to ask

For an ending that isn’t so bitter

As the last?

Is it

Too

Hard

To maintain something like this with getting bored?

not if we live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.`

    lyrics: `Dyed in daybreak's light
Sound asleep, curled
Blue bird's first flight
Silent world

Burnished by Autumn
Trees hued in crimson
Yet the days darken
Now you've gone away

Waking from a dream
The sun floods her eyes
To unravel such a scene
Of scarlet splendour

Burnished by Autumn
Trees hued in crimson
Yet the days darken
Now you've gone away

"If I went out...
Maybe we could find the door to my mothers garden
If we found the door, we could go inside"`,

      `The song reminded me of her. Her eyes, her quietness, the way she carried this kind of fragile sweetness like she didn’t even know it was there. She once told me...`,
      `I came into her life at the perfect time. Said I saved her. That she was falling apart and I showed up like some kind of angel, holding things together that weren’t mine to fix, but I tried anyway. And I would’ve kept trying. I would’ve done anything for her. Every time the song played she cried. 

And back then I thought it was love, or at least something close to it. I asked her about it long after we broke up. What those tears meant. And she told me the truth. She said it was guilt, mostly. That she never found me attractive. That she didn’t know how to tell me. But also she said it was because of the immense love I gave her. Because she had never felt something that deep, that safe, that unconditional. It overwhelmed her. And it broke her heart, knowing she couldn’t feel it back. 

I think about that a lot. How someone can cry both for what they don’t feel and for what they were never given before. It doesn’t make the pain go away, but it softens it. Just a bit. Enough to remember her without bitterness. The song still makes me think of her. Not because of what we were. But because of how hard I loved her. How much I gave. And how maybe, for a moment, even if it wasn’t love, she felt it too. Listening to it doesn’t break me anymore. It just lingers, like the echo of something gentle that didn’t stay. Maybe that’s all love ever really is. Something soft that leaves a mark.`
