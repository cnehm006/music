    lyrics: `Baby please, it's the way you speak
Forming words so easily
And I think of the way you think
It keeps me from falling asleep
In that grave I call a bed
Until you called me up and said:

"I haven't stopped crying
My father's been drinking
I need a place to stay
I don't want to be here
He's saying the words that
He promised he would never say
That liquid he consumes
Makes him speak the truth"

And I said, "No, It's not that at all
It's that bottle of lies for a troubled heart
It's standing on the edge of a mountain top
Screaming anything he wants like
"Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Because I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist"

I remember the way you shook
It's a shame that we're not soul mates
Because if I didn't know better
I'd say this feels pretty good
And how could I be scared
When I stretch and feel you're there
So shut your mouth
Because these words will speak themselves
I can feel them in these blankets
And they're surrounding your figure
Embraced in the quilts
And I can't help but think
You're my missing puzzle piece

I wake up in the hallway, I'm looking for sunlight
With the rays that will cure me of the pain that keeps my lungs tight
Ignoring the voices and feelings that tell me
To get out of this house
I can't make them stop
I'm just like my mom

And you said, "No, these demons will fall
You're so precious to us all"
And I said, "I, I can't do this alone
I still need you to hold
So don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Because I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid"`,
    note: `I’m gonna change. Okay? I can do it. I can change. I will be who I want to be. People grow and change. Some day, I won’t hate myself and the people I surround myself with. I’ll be okay. We can do this.`

    note: `maybe you could hurt me

Hurt me just a little

To help me ease the pain

Or maybe you could kill me

One to the back of the head

Just leave me in the rain

Or what if we decided

Instead we’d hold each other

For a little while

But maybe forever

And maybe we’d be the fifty percent

That didn’t quite make it

Or maybe we could have it all

Twenty kids and a picket

And maybe..

We could live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.

Maybe it’s a little

Silly fantasy of mine

But we could build our home

In the thickets and vines

No one around to bother us

No one to bring us harm

Just me and our beach home

And you to keep me warm..

oh..

We could live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.

Is it

So

Much to ask

For an ending that isn’t so bitter

As the last?

Is it

Too

Hard

To maintain something like this with getting bored?

not if we live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.`

    lyrics: `Dyed in daybreak's light
Sound asleep, curled
Blue bird's first flight
Silent world

Burnished by Autumn
Trees hued in crimson
Yet the days darken
Now you've gone away

Waking from a dream
The sun floods her eyes
To unravel such a scene
Of scarlet splendour

Burnished by Autumn
Trees hued in crimson
Yet the days darken
Now you've gone away

"If I went out...
Maybe we could find the door to my mothers garden
If we found the door, we could go inside"`,

      `The song reminded me of her. Her eyes, her quietness, the way she carried this kind of fragile sweetness like she didn’t even know it was there. She once told me...`,
      `I came into her life at the perfect time. Said I saved her. That she was falling apart and I showed up like some kind of angel, holding things together that weren’t mine to fix, but I tried anyway. And I would’ve kept trying. I would’ve done anything for her. Every time the song played she cried. 

And back then I thought it was love, or at least something close to it. I asked her about it long after we broke up. What those tears meant. And she told me the truth. She said it was guilt, mostly. That she never found me attractive. That she didn’t know how to tell me. But also she said it was because of the immense love I gave her. Because she had never felt something that deep, that safe, that unconditional. It overwhelmed her. And it broke her heart, knowing she couldn’t feel it back. 

I think about that a lot. How someone can cry both for what they don’t feel and for what they were never given before. It doesn’t make the pain go away, but it softens it. Just a bit. Enough to remember her without bitterness. The song still makes me think of her. Not because of what we were. But because of how hard I loved her. How much I gave. And how maybe, for a moment, even if it wasn’t love, she felt it too. Listening to it doesn’t break me anymore. It just lingers, like the echo of something gentle that didn’t stay. Maybe that’s all love ever really is. Something soft that leaves a mark.`

    lyrics: `The sun is at stake
And I'm at your window
Beyond all sleep
And I can't speak
In all Tokyo
Translate memories
That I cannot free
But what will it take?

We all make mistakes
We all try to free
The sighs of the past
We don't want to last
Need love erase
To let out my mind
Wanting to love as new as I can
Wanting to show
I want my scars to help and heal
How much you wanted, so much you found

Try not to beg too much to be
Calling my heart and know you are real
But my memory steals every moment I can feel
What will it take?

We all make mistakes
Even though I try to stand
Even though it's slowly
I do all I can
But who is my man?
The memory or you?
The love or the due?
To carry a face I can not retrace
I do all I can
We all make mistakes`,

      `I started listening to this stupid song near the end of our relationship. Not before. Just when things started to feel`,
      ` off in small, quiet ways. The kind of fights that didn’t leave bruises, but lingered like a fog. I didn’t play the song to make her feel guilty or to dramatize anything. it just helped me sit with whatever I didn’t know how to say out loud. She saw it on my listening activity once and told me to stop. Said it was too sad. Said we could get through anything, even that. And maybe a part of me wanted to believe her. But the song stayed longer than she did. After we broke up, I kept playing it like a reflex. I’d sit in the work car after my shift, parked in some quiet lot, and just fall apart. I’d bawl my eyes out. chest tight, hands shaking, like something in me had cracked open and refused to shut. I had never cried like that before. It wasn’t voluntary. It was like my body was trying to process something my head couldn’t wrap itself around. I don’t want to go back to that place. But in some way, I needed it. It reminded me I was still capable of feeling something that deeply. That I wasn’t numb. Not yet.

Sometimes when the song comes on now, especially when I’ve been drinking a bit too much and the world feels blurry and soft, I start drifting. My head goes back to those nights we spent on video call, playing games, talking about everything and nothing. I remember how sometimes she’d cry, and I’d stay up comforting her, doing my best to hold space for whatever she was carrying. I helped her with so much. school, life, stress, her friendships. and never asked for anything back. She felt like my other half, not in some perfect soulmate way, but in a way that made the world feel less lonely. And maybe yea in that perfect soulmate way. I still remember her room like I’d been there. pale walls, her bed always just behind the camera, her laptop perched on the table. I remember how fast she typed and how it caught me off guard on our first date. I have never witnessed someone type faster than me, let alone my girlfriend. That's how I knew I was head over heels for her. Because I had this realization, and I wasn't jealous or anything. I was in awe. Also how we sat together in the library, holding hands and listening to music through shared earbuds. How she played Brawlhalla with just the keyboard and still beat me (because she taught me how to play). How we built a house in Minecraft like it meant something. How she’d carry me in Valorant and talk shit the whole time. Her voice, soft and sarcastic, still echoes in the back of my mind sometimes. The try on hauls over FaceTime, the late-night calls, the way we fell into each other’s lives without warning. We were young, but it felt like we had carved out a little space in the world that belonged just to us.

The beat drop in this song still ruins me. Every time. It doesn’t come in loud at all. it creeps in like something breaking open slowly. It’s where everything in the song swells without needing to scream. That moment makes me feel everything all at once. Like all the weight, all the tenderness, all the grief, and love and confusion are colliding in a single breath. It hits in the same way those memories do. unexpected but familiar. I think that’s what makes the song so brutal. It doesn’t try too hard. 

And now... I don’t hate her. I don’t even resent her. I just hope she’s okay. I hope she’s happy in whatever life she’s building now. I still think All I Can is one of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard, ever. Not because it’s sad but because it reminds me I loved someone enough to feel like that when it ended. And maybe she didn’t feel it the same way. Maybe she never could. But I did. And I still do, sometimes. Not in a way that needs to go back. but in a way that thanks her quietly, even now, for being part of that chapter. Whatever, honestly. I don't know. End scene.`
