    lyrics: `Baby please, it's the way you speak
Forming words so easily
And I think of the way you think
It keeps me from falling asleep
In that grave I call a bed
Until you called me up and said:

"I haven't stopped crying
My father's been drinking
I need a place to stay
I don't want to be here
He's saying the words that
He promised he would never say
That liquid he consumes
Makes him speak the truth"

And I said, "No, It's not that at all
It's that bottle of lies for a troubled heart
It's standing on the edge of a mountain top
Screaming anything he wants like
"Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Because I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist"

I remember the way you shook
It's a shame that we're not soul mates
Because if I didn't know better
I'd say this feels pretty good
And how could I be scared
When I stretch and feel you're there
So shut your mouth
Because these words will speak themselves
I can feel them in these blankets
And they're surrounding your figure
Embraced in the quilts
And I can't help but think
You're my missing puzzle piece

I wake up in the hallway, I'm looking for sunlight
With the rays that will cure me of the pain that keeps my lungs tight
Ignoring the voices and feelings that tell me
To get out of this house
I can't make them stop
I'm just like my mom

And you said, "No, these demons will fall
You're so precious to us all"
And I said, "I, I can't do this alone
I still need you to hold
So don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Because I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid"`,
    note: `I’m gonna change. Okay? I can do it. I can change. I will be who I want to be. People grow and change. Some day, I won’t hate myself and the people I surround myself with. I’ll be okay. We can do this.`

    note: `maybe you could hurt me

Hurt me just a little

To help me ease the pain

Or maybe you could kill me

One to the back of the head

Just leave me in the rain

Or what if we decided

Instead we’d hold each other

For a little while

But maybe forever

And maybe we’d be the fifty percent

That didn’t quite make it

Or maybe we could have it all

Twenty kids and a picket

And maybe..

We could live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.

Maybe it’s a little

Silly fantasy of mine

But we could build our home

In the thickets and vines

No one around to bother us

No one to bring us harm

Just me and our beach home

And you to keep me warm..

oh..

We could live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.

Is it

So

Much to ask

For an ending that isn’t so bitter

As the last?

Is it

Too

Hard

To maintain something like this with getting bored?

not if we live near the beach

In a tall, tall mountain

Johnson and sea grass

Floating like ribbons

Seagulls would fly overhead

We would dance to our music

We would worry about nothing

We have time for that when we’re dead.`
